1. CodeBook.md is a code book describing the data, variables, and alterations made to clean up the data.

2. run_analysis.R is a R script that
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
3. Ind_Data.txt is the final exported data.
